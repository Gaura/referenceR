###Date and Time

In R, date is and time belong to classes Date and POSIXct/POSIXlt respectively. Date is internally stored as in integer representing the number of days from 1-1-1970. POSIX probably stands for Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) which are standards to ensure compatability b/w different OS. 'ct' stands for calendar time and 'lt' stands for local time. POSIXct stores the time as number of seconds since 1-1-1970 and POSIXlt stores it as a list of hour, min, sec, tzone (timezone) etc.
```{r}
Sys.Date() #To get current date, similarly for time Sys.time()
unclass(Sys.Date()) #It'll be an integer, number of days since 1-1-1970
```
