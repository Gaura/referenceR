Here is a guide to using caret package in predictive modelling: https://www.r-project.org/conferences/useR-2013/Tutorials/kuhn/user_caret_2up.pdf

It is a useful package that consists of functions that unify predictive models from different packages.
It contains functions to do basic stuff like train test split in R.

Setup
```{r setup}
library(kernlab)
library(caret)
```
Creat data split
```{r}
?createDataPartition #shows up other useful functions as well
data("spam")
train <- createDataPartition(y = spam$type, p = 0.75, list = FALSE)
training <- spam[train,]
testing <- spam[-train,]
```
This function creates a training model and the performance measured is calculated based on resampling measure bootstrap
```{r}
model <- train(type ~ ., data = training, method = "glm")
model$finalModel # to view the final model
prediction <- predict(model,newdata= testing)
prediction
confusionMatrix(prediction,testing$type)
```
